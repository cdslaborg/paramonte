The easiest way to build and install the ParaMonte library and its examples is via the 
[Linux/macOS Bash](https://github.com/cdslaborg/paramonte/blob/main/install.sh.usage.txt) and 
[Windows Batch](https://github.com/cdslaborg/paramonte/blob/main/install.bat.usage.txt) 
install scripts that exist at the root of the ParaMonte repository on GitHub. 
The scripts will automatically install the library and run the tests (if requested) and the examples provided.  

However, if there are still good reasons to build library directly via the cmake software 
and manually go through all the rest of the build, testing, and installation processes, 
then you can follow the guidelines below to predefine the various settings of the library and its tests.  

**Note** that the ParaMonte library build via cmake is currently exclusively available and tested on Linux, macOS, and Microsoft WSL platforms.  

1.  Ensure a [ParaMonte-compatible](CHANGES.md) version of the GNU or Intel compiler suite 
    is already installed on the system and the paths to the different components of the 
    compiler and wrappers already exist in the environmental `PATH` variable. 
    (**This step would be automatically done via the [`install.sh` script](https://github.com/cdslaborg/paramonte/blob/main/install.sh.usage.txt).**)  
1.  Ensure a ParaMonte-compatible cmake installation (`3.14.0` or newer) exists on your system 
    and the path to the cmake executable already exist in the environmental `PATH` variable. 
    (**This step would be automatically done via the [`install.sh` script](https://github.com/cdslaborg/paramonte/blob/main/install.sh.usage.txt).**)  
1.  Navigate to the root directory of the library (where the `.git` file exists).  
1.  Then, assuming that you are using the GNU compiler suite, you can configure the library's build minimally via,  
    ```bash  
    mkdir build && \
    cd build && \
    cmake -DPMCS=GNU ..
    ```  
    (**This step would be automatically done via the [`install.sh` script](https://github.com/cdslaborg/paramonte/blob/main/install.sh.usage.txt).**)  
1.  The above command will configure the library with the default build settings. 
    To change the default settings, the following macros can be also defined,  
    ```bash  
    mkdir build && \
    cd build && \
    cmake \
    --verbose=1 \
    -DPMCS="the compiler suite: GNU/INTEL" \
    -DPMLIB_NAME="you_must_follow_the_guidelines_here:https://www.cdslab.org/paramonte/notes/installation/readme/#naming-convention-used-for-paramonte-library-builds" \
    -DCMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER="/path/to/the/specific/fortran/compiler/executable/to/be/used/example:/usr/bin/gfortran-10" \
    -DMATLAB_ROOT_DIR="/if/building/for/matlab/provide/path/to/the/matlab/root/installation/directory/where/bin/dir/exists" \
    -DMPIEXEC_EXECUTABLE="/path/to/the/specific/mpi/launcher/to/be/used" \
    -DINTERFACE_LANGUAGE="the single programming language interface: c/cpp/fortran/matlab/python/... (default = c)" \
    -DMPI_ENABLED="whether building for MPI parallelization: true/false (default = false)" \
    -DCAFTYPE="The Coarray parallelization type: none/single/shared/distributed (default = none)" \
    -DBTYPE="library build: debug/testing/release (default = release)" \
    -DLTYPE="library type: static/shared (default = static)" \
    -DHEAP_ARRAY_ENABLED="whether to perform all memory allocations on the heap: true/false (default = false)" \
    -DCFI_ENABLED="whether C-Fortran interoperation must be enabled: true/false (default = true)" \
    -DOMP_ENABLED="whether OpenMP parallelization must be enabled: true/false (default = false)" \
    -DMPILIB_NAME="The MPI library name: impi/mpich/openmpi (impi stands for Intel MPI)" \
    -DSAMPLER_TEST_ENABLED="whether the library's sampler tests should be enabled: true/false (default = false)" \
    -DBASIC_TEST_ENABLED="whether the library's basic tests should be enabled: true/false (default = false)" \
    -DPERFPROF_ENABLED="whether the library should be build for performance profiling: true/false (default = false)" \
    -DCODECOV_ENABLED="whether the library should be build for code coverage: true/false (default = false)" \
    -DOS_IS_WSL="whether the current operating system is Microsoft WSL" \
    ..
    ```  
    (**All of the above configuration settings could be easily done via the [`install.sh` script](https://github.com/cdslaborg/paramonte/blob/main/install.sh.usage.txt).**)  
1.  Once you configure the library's build, try,  
    ```bash  
    make -j 3 && make install
    ```  
    Replace the number `3` with as many number of cores you wish to use to build the library. 
    (**This step would be automatically done via the [`install.sh` script](https://github.com/cdslaborg/paramonte/blob/main/install.sh.usage.txt).**)  
1.  The ParaMonte library should be now built and installed in the `lib` directory. 
    If you built the library for testing or code coverage purposes, then a `testParaMonte` 
    executable must also exist in the subdirectory `test/bin/`. The onus is on the developer/user (presumably you) 
    to ensure all runtime libraries and dependencies can be found by the library or the test executable or the examples.  
    (**All dependency checks and test runs would be automatically done via the [`install.sh` script](https://github.com/cdslaborg/paramonte/blob/main/install.sh.usage.txt).**)
