ParaMonte: Plain Powerful Parallel Monte Carlo Library
======================================================
  
ParaMonte is a serial/parallel library of Monte Carlo routines for sampling mathematical objective functions 
of arbitrary-dimensions, in particular, the posterior distributions of Bayesian models in data science, Machine Learning, 
and scientific inference, with the design goal of unifying the **automation** (of Monte Carlo simulations), 
**user-friendliness** (of the library), **accessibility** (from multiple programming environments), 
**high-performance** (at runtime), and **scalability** (across many parallel processors).  

For more information on the installation, usage, and examples, visit: https://www.cdslab.org/paramonte  
  
  
ParaMonte design goals  
======================  

ParaMonte has been developed while bearing the following design goals in mind:  

-   **Full automation** of all Monte Carlo simulations to the highest levels possible to ensure the highest level of user-friendliness 
    of the library and minimal time investment requirements for building, running, and post-processing of simulation models.  

-   **Interoperability** of the core library with as many programming languages as currently possible, 
    including C, C++, Fortran, MATLAB, Python, with ongoing efforts to support other popular programming languages.  

-   **High-Performance** meticulously-low-level implementation of the library to ensure the fastest-possible Monte Carlo simulations.  

-   **Parallelizability** of all simulations via two-sided and one-sided MPI/Coarray 
    communications while requiring zero-parallel-coding efforts by the user.  

-   **Zero-dependence** on external libraries to ensure hassle-free ParaMonte library builds and ParaMonte simulation runs.  

-   **Fully-deterministic reproducibility** and automatically-enabled restart functionality 
    for all simulations up to 16 digits of precision as requested by the user.  

-   **Comprehensive-reporting and post-processing** of each simulation and its results, as well as their automatic storage in 
    external files to ensure the simulation results will be comprehensible and reproducible at any time in the distant future.

In most cases, ParaMonte will automatically install the required missing libraries on your system (with your permission). 
These automatic checks and installations happen when you download and install or use the library on your system, for the first time. 
If the automatic installation is unsuccessful, you can also install the libraries manually on your system:  

+   On **Windows** and **Linux** operating systems, we highly recommend downloading and installing the

+   For complete clear organized up-to-date instructions on the build process and the installation of the ParaMonte library, visit: [cdslab.org/pm](https://www.cdslab.org/paramonte)  

## Quick start  

+   Go to the [release page of the ParaMonte library on GitHub](https://github.com/cdslaborg/paramonte/releases).  
+   Decide on the parallelism paradigm that you want to use: serial / MPI.  
+   Decide on the Operating System (OS) on which you want to run the ParaMonte simulations: Windows / macOS / Linux.  
+   Learn about the naming convention used for the ParaMonte prebuilt libraries
    [here](https://www.cdslab.org/paramonte/notes/installation/readme/#naming-convention-used-for-paramonte-library-builds).  
+   Download the prebuilt ParaMonte library of your choice based on the decisions you have made in the above. 
    If you are not sure which prebuilt library is suitable for your needs, use the prebuilt library recommended 
    [here for Windows](https://www.cdslab.org/paramonte/notes/installation/windows/#using-the-prebuilt-paramonte-library), 
    or [here for Linux](https://www.cdslab.org/paramonte/notes/installation/linux/#using-the-prebuilt-paramonte-library), 
    or [here for macOS](https://www.cdslab.org/paramonte/notes/installation/macos/#using-the-prebuilt-paramonte-library).  
+   Each prebuilt library ships with a full-fledged set of example codes and build scripts. Uncompress the prebuilt library:  
    +   On **Windows**: Simply double-click on the zip-file and select **extract files** from the Windows Explorer menu.  
    +   On **macOS/Linux**: Open a Bash terminal and navigate to the folder containing the compressed library. 
        Use the following command to untar the compressed file,  
        ```  
        ls libparamonte*.tar.gz* | xargs -i tar xvzf {}
        ```  
        to extract all libparamonte tar files in the current directory.  

### Building and running ParaMonte simulations on Windows  

+   **Note**: Theoretically, you can use any C/C++ compiler on Windows to build and link your applications against the ParaMonte library. 
    However, the ParaMonte library example build scripts, as described below, currently only recognize the Microsoft and Intel C/C++ compilers.  

+   **Note**: Theoretically, you can use any Fortran compiler on Windows to build and link your applications against the ParaMonte library.  
    A few options currently exist regarding the choice of compilers and environment:  
    +   Use the Intel Visual C/C++ compiler or the Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler along with the Windows **Batch build scripts** of the ParaMonte library examples.  
    +   Use the **Bash build scripts** that are also supplied with each ParaMonte example on Windows to build and run simulations via 
        the GNU compilers on Windows available in MinGW or Cygwin Linux environments installed on a Windows system.  
    +   Use the GNU compiler installed on a [Microsoft Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux). 
        In this case, you will have to download the prebuilt ParaMonte library for the Linux environment as opposed to the Windows OS. 

+   **Install the Microsoft Visual Studio (>2017)**: You will need to have a recent Microsoft Visual Studio (MSVS) installed on your system. 
    The community edition of this software is available free of charge. When installing MSVS, 
    make sure to install all the C++ components and compiler of the Visual Studio.  

+   **Install the Intel Parallel Studio**: If you are a student/teacher/faculty/open-source-developer, you can also download and install, free of charge, 
    the most recent **Intel Parallel Studio** on your system which, by default, includes the Intel MPI library. You can follow the instructions given 
    [on this page](https://www.cdslab.org/recipes/programming/intel-parallel-studio-installation-windows/intel-parallel-studio-installation-windows) 
    to install the Intel Parallel Studio on your system.  

+   **Open the right command-line interface to build/run the ParaMonte example**: 
    If the ParaMonte library that you intend to use is built for 64-bit architecture, 
    then make sure you open a 64-bit instance of the command-line interface in either of the two cases below:  
    +   If you have installed Intel Parallel Studio, open an instance of the **command-line interface** 
        that comes with Intel Parallel Studio from the list of programs in the Windows start menu. 
        This is simply a Windows command prompt that has all the necessary Intel compiler variables and paths predefined in it.  
    +   Otherwise, if you do not have Intel Parallel Studio, open an instance of the **command-line interface** that comes with 
        the Microsoft Visual Studio from the list of programs in the Windows start menu. This is simply a Windows command prompt 
        that has all the necessary Microsoft compiler variables and paths predefined in it.  

+   **Build and run the ParaMonte example**:  
    +   To Build the example via the Intel Parallel Studio command-line interface,  
        ```  
        build.bat  
        ```  
    +   To build the example via the Microsoft Visual Studio C/C++ compiler,  
        ```  
        build.bat msvc  
        ```  
        where the passed argument `msvc` implies the use of Microsoft Visual C++ compiler for building the application.  
    The build script will automatically detect whether a parallel simulation has been built. By default, the name of 
    the output executable is `main.exe`. *Note that the build script will both build and run the executable*.    

+   **Run the ParaMonte example executable**:  
    +   For serial simulations, simply type the name of the output executable,  
        ```
        main.exe
        ```
    +   For parallel simulations, invoke the MPI launcher `mpiexec`,  
        ```
        mpiexec -n NUM_PROCESSES main.exe
        ```
        where `NUM_PROCESSES` represents the number of processes on which the simulation will run. 
        If you are using the Intel MPI library to run your ParaMonte application in parallel, we also recommend using the `-localonly` flag. 
        See [this page](https://www.cdslab.org/paramonte/notes/run/#running-the-manually-generated-executable-on-multiple-processors-on-windows)

+   **Note**: Theoretically, you can use any C/C++ compiler on macOS/Linux to build and link your applications against the ParaMonte library. 
    However, the ParaMonte library example build scripts, as described below, currently only recognize the Intel and GNU C/C++ compilers.  

+   If you intend to run **serial** ParaMonte simulations, install either,  
    +   **the Intel C/C++ compiler (icc/icpc >2018)**, or,  
    +   **the GNU C/C++ compiler (gcc/g++ >7.0.0)**,  
    on your system. If you follow the full installation instructions of the ParaMonte library, 
    these compiler prerequisites will be automatically installed for you.  

+   If you intend to run **MPI parallel** ParaMonte simulations, install either,  
    +   **the Intel Parallel Studio (>2018)** on Linux, or,  
    +   **the GNU Compiler Collection (>7.0.0) and the MPICH (>3.2) library** on Linux,  
    +   **the GNU Compiler Collection (>7.0.0) and the OpenMPI (>4.0) library** on macOS,  
    on your system. If you follow the full installation instructions of the ParaMonte library, 
    these compiler prerequisites will be automatically installed for you.  
    Note that on **macOS**, only the latter option (the GNU compilers) is 
    available since the Intel MPI library does not support the macOS platform.  

+   Open a Bash terminal, change directory to the ParaMonte prebuilt library's directory, then build the executable via,  
    ```  
    build.sh  
    ```  
    The build script will automatically detect whether a parallel simulation has to be built. 
    By default, the name of the output executable is `main.exe`. The script will also generate a new Bash script named `run.sh`. 
    To run the generated example executable, type,  
    ```  
    ./run.sh
    ```  
    The script will automatically detect whether the simulation has to be run in parallel or serial. 
    If the simulation is parallel, you can also pass the number of cores on which you want to run the example via,  
    ```  
    ./run.sh --nproc NUM_PROCESSOR
    ```  
    or,  
    ```  
    ./run.sh -n NUM_PROCESSOR
    ```  
    where you will have to replace `NUM_PROCESSOR` with your desired number of processes.

+   For complete clear organized up-to-date instructions on the build process and the installation 
    of the ParaMonte library, visit: [cdslab.org/pm](https://www.cdslab.org/paramonte)  

## Quick start  

+   Go to the [release page of the ParaMonte library on GitHub](https://github.com/cdslaborg/paramonte/releases),  
+   Decide on the parallelism paradigm that you want to use: serial / MPI 
    (the Coarray Fortran implementation is not available as a prebuilt dynamic library),  
+   Decide on the Operating System (OS) on which you want to run the ParaMonte simulations: Windows / macOS / Linux,  
+   Learn about the naming convention used for the ParaMonte prebuilt libraries [here](https://www.cdslab.org/paramonte/notes/installation/readme/#naming-convention-used-for-paramonte-library-builds),  
+   Download the prebuilt ParaMonte library of your choice based on the decisions you have made in the above. 
    If you are not sure which prebuilt library is suitable for your needs, use the prebuilt library recommended 
    [here for Windows](https://www.cdslab.org/paramonte/notes/installation/windows/#using-the-prebuilt-paramonte-library), or 
    [here for Linux](https://www.cdslab.org/paramonte/notes/installation/linux/#using-the-prebuilt-paramonte-library), or 
    [here for macOS](https://www.cdslab.org/paramonte/notes/installation/macos/#using-the-prebuilt-paramonte-library).  
+   Each prebuilt library ships with a full-fledged set of example codes and build scripts. Uncompress the prebuilt library:  
    +   On **Windows**: Simply double-click on the zip-file and select **extract files** from the Windows Explorer menu.  
    +   On **macOS/Linux**: Open a Bash terminal and navigate to the folder containing the compressed library. 
        Use the following command to untar the compressed file,  
        ```  
        ls libparamonte*.tar.gz | xargs -i tar xvzf {}
        ```  
        to extract all libparamonte tar files in the current directory.  

### Building and running ParaMonte simulations on Windows  

+   **Note**: Theoretically, you can use any Fortran compiler on Windows to build and link your applications against the ParaMonte library.  
    A few options currently exist regarding the choice of compilers and environment:  
    +   Use the Intel Fortran compiler along with the Windows **Batch build scripts** of the ParaMonte library examples, as described below.  
    +   Use the **Bash build scripts** that are also supplied with each ParaMonte example on Windows to build and run simulations via 
        the GNU compilers on Windows available in MinGW or Cygwin Linux environments installed on a Windows system.  
    +   Use the GNU Fortran compiler installed on a [Microsoft Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux). 
        In this case, you will have to download the prebuilt ParaMonte library for the Linux environment as opposed to the Windows OS. 

+   **Install the Microsoft Visual Studio (>2017)**: You will need to have a recent Microsoft Visual Studio (MSVS) installed on your system. 
    The community edition of this software is available free of charge. When installing MSVS, 
    make sure to install all the C++ components of the Visual Studio.  

+   **Install the Intel Parallel Studio**: If you are a student/teacher/faculty/open-source-developer, you can also download and install, free of charge, 
    the most recent **Intel Parallel Studio** on your system which, by default, includes the Intel MPI library. You can follow the instructions given 
    [on this page](https://www.cdslab.org/recipes/programming/intel-parallel-studio-installation-windows/intel-parallel-studio-installation-windows) 
    to install the Intel Parallel Studio on your system.  

+   **Open the right command-line interface to build/run the ParaMonte example**: 
    If the ParaMonte library that you intend to use is built for 64-bit architecture, 
    then make sure you open a 64-bit instance of the command-line interface in either of the two cases below:  
    +   If you have installed Intel Parallel Studio, open an instance of the **command-line interface** that comes 
        with the Intel Parallel Studio from the list of programs in the Windows start menu. This is simply a Windows 
        command prompt that has all the necessary Intel compiler variables and paths predefined in it.  
    +   Otherwise, if you do not have Intel Parallel Studio, open an instance of the **command-line interface** that comes 
        with the Microsoft Visual Studio from the list of programs in the Windows start menu. This is simply a Windows 
        command prompt that has all the necessary compiler variables and paths predefined in it.  

+   **Build and run the ParaMonte example**:  
    Build the example via the Intel Parallel Studio command-line interface,  
    ```  
    build.bat  
    ```  
    The build script will automatically detect whether a parallel simulation has been built. 
    By default, the name of the output executable is `main.exe`. 
    *Note that the build script will both build and run the executable*.  

+   **Run the ParaMonte example executable**:  
    +   For serial simulations, simply type the name of the output executable,  
        ```  
        main.exe
        ```  
    +   For parallel simulations, invoke the MPI launcher `mpiexec`,  
        ```  
        mpiexec -n NUM_PROCESSES main.exe
        ```  
        where `NUM_PROCESSES` represents the number of processes on which the simulation will run. 
        If you are using the Intel MPI library to run your ParaMonte application in parallel, we also recommend using the `-localonly` flag. 
        See [this page](https://www.cdslab.org/paramonte/notes/run/#running-the-manually-generated-executable-on-multiple-processors-on-windows)

+   If you intend to run Coarray parallel ParaMonte simulations, install either,  
    +   **the Intel Parallel Studio (>2018)**, or,  
    +   **the GNU Compiler Collection (>7.0.0) and OpenCoarrays (>2.8.0)**, 
    on your system. If you follow the full installation instructions of the ParaMonte library,
