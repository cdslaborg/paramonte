    !>                                      When divided by the corresponding output cluster size, it will yield the final updated cluster centers.

    !> \warning
    !> There is no benefit in calling this routine for `nc = 1`.
    !> As such, calling this routine with `nc = 1` will lead to undefined behavior.
