!
!   ParaMonte input file for sampling a multivariate 4-dimensional Gaussian distribution as implemented in the accompanying source files.
!
!   USAGE
!
!   Comments must begin with an exclamation mark (!).
!   Comments can appear anywhere on an empty line or, after a value assignment.
!   all variable assignments are optional and can be commented out. In such cases, appropriate default values will be assigned.
!   Use ParaDRAM namelist (group) name to group a set of ParaDRAM simulation specification variables.
!   The order of the input variables in the namelist groups is irrelevant and unimportant.
!   Variables can be defined multiple times, but only the last definition will be considered as input.
!   All variable names are case insensitive. However, for clarity, this software follows the camelCase code-writing practice.
!   String values must be enclosed with either single or double quotation marks.
!   Logical values are case-insensitive and can be either .true., true, or t for a TRUE value, and .false., false, or f for a FALSE value.
!   All vectors and arrays in the input file begin with index 1. This is following the convention of 
!   the majority of science-oriented programming languages: Fortran, Julia, Mathematica, MATLAB, and R.
!
!   For comprehensive guidelines on the input file organization and rules, visit: 
!
!       https://www.cdslab.org/paramonte/notes/usage/interface/
!
!   The following &ParaDRAM namelist group assigns the simulation specifications of 
!   an example ParaDRAM sampling of a 4-dimensional Multivariate Normal Distribution.
