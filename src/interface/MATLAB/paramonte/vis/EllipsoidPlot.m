%
%   EllipsoidPlot(plotType, dataFrame, resetExternal)
%
%   This is the EllipsoidPlot class for generating instances of
%   ellipsoid-evolution plots via MATLAB's builtin function `plot()`.
%   It generates a plot of 2D ellipsoids corresponding to the input 
%   list of covariance/correlation matrices.
%
%       NOTE
%
%           This is a low-level ParaMonte class and is not meant
%           to be directly instantiated by the user.
%
%   Parameters
%   ----------
%
%       dataFrame
%
%           A MATLAB Table containing the covariance/correlation matrices 
%           that represent the characteristic covariance/correlation of ellipsoids. 
%           The covariance/correlation-matrix column of the input dataFrame must be a 3D 
%           matrix of the size (nrows,ndim,ndim) where count is the number of dataFrame nrows.
%
%   Attributes
%   ----------
%
%       dimensionPair
%
%           A pair of indices (vector of length 2) whose value determine the rows 
%           and columns from the covariance/correlation matrix which will be plotted.
%           The default value is dimensionPair = [1,2].
%
%           Example usage:
%
%               1.  dimensionPair = [1,2]
%               2.  dimensionPair = [3,1]
%
%           WARNING: In all cases, the indices must be distinct from each other and less 
%           WARNING: than ndim where ndim is the rank of the covariance/correlation matrix.
%
%       matrixColumn
%
%           The name of the column of the input dataFrame that represents the 
%           of the covariance/correlation or correlation matrices of the ellipsoids.
%
%       centerColumn
%
%           The name of the column of the input dataFrame that represents the 
%           corresponding center mean-vectors of the covariance/correlation matrices.
%
%       zcolumn (available only in 3D plotting objects)
%
%           Optional property that determines the column of dataFrame to serve as
%           the z-values. It can have multiple forms:
%
%               1.  a numeric or cell array of column indices in the input dataFrame.
%               2.  a string or cell array of column names in dataFrame.Properties.VariableNames.
%               3.  a cell array of a mix of the above two.
%               4.  a numeric range.
%
%           Example usage:
%
%               1.  zcolumn = 2
%               2.  zcolumn = "sampleSize"
%
%           WARNING: In all cases, zcolumn must have a length that is either 0, or 1
%           WARNING: If it is an empty object having length 0, then the default value will be used.
%
%           The default value is the index of the covariance/correlation matrices in the input data frame.
%
%       npoint
%
%           The number of points used to represent the ellipsoids. The higher the 
%           value of npoint is, the higher-resolution the ellipsoids would look like.
%
%           The default value is 100.
%
%       ccolumn (standing for color-columns)
%
%           Optional property that determines the columns of dataFrame to serve
%           as the color-mapping-values for each line/point element in the plot.
%           It can have multiple forms:
%
%               1.  a numeric or cell array of column indices in the input dataFrame.
%               2.  a string or cell array of column names in dataFrame.Properties.VariableNames.
%               3.  a cell array of a mix of the above two.
%               4.  a numeric range.
%
%           Example usage:
%
%               1.  ccolumn = 7
%               2.  ccolumn = "sampleSize"
%
%           WARNING: In all cases, ccolumn must have a length that is either 0, or 1.
%           WARNING: If the length is 1, then all data will be plotted with the same color 
%           WARNING: mapping determined by values specified by the elements of ccolumn. 
%           WARNING: If it is an empty object having length 0, then the default value will be used.
%
%           The default value is the indices of the rows of the input dataFrame.
%
%       colormap (available only in histogram2/contourf/contour3/contour objects) 
%
%           A MATLAB struct() with the following components:
%
%               enabled
%
%                   A logical value. If `true`, the colormap will be applied 
%                   to the plot. 
%
%               values
%
%                   A string or any other value that the colormap function 
%                   of MATLAB accepts as input.
%
%           Example usage:
%
%               1.  colormap.enabled = true;
%               1.  colormap.values = "winter";
%               1.  colormap.values = "autumn";
%
%       colorbar (available only in histogram2/contourf/contour3/contour objects) 
%
%           A MATLAB struct() with the following components:
%
%               enabled
%
%                   A logical value. If `true`, the colorbar will be applied to the plot.
%
%               kws
%
%                   A MATLAB struct() whose components' values are passed to 
%                   MATLAB's colorbar() function. If your desired attribute is 
%                   missing from the fieldnames of colorbar.kws, simply add 
%                   a new field named as the attribute and assign the desired 
%                   value to it.
%
%           Example usage:
%
%               colorbar.enabled = true; % add colorbar
%               colorbar.kws.location = "west";
%
%           WARNING
%
%               Keep in mind that MATLAB keyword arguments are case-INsensitive.
%               Hence, sure you do not add the keyword as multiple different fields.
%               For example, colorbar.kws.color and colorbar.kws.Color are the same,
%               and only one of the two will be processed.
%
%       plot
%
%           A MATLAB struct() with the following components:
%
%               enabled
%
%                   A logical value. If `true`, the plot() will be added to the plot.
%

%
%                   A MATLAB struct() whose components' values are passed to 
%                   MATLAB's plot() function. If your desired attribute is 
%                   missing from the fieldnames of plot.kws, simply add 
%                   a new field named as the attribute and assign the desired 
%                   value to it.
%
%           Example usage:
%
%               plot.enabled = true; % add plot()
%               plot.kws.lineWidth = "none";
%
%           WARNING
%
%               Keep in mind that MATLAB keyword arguments are case-INsensitive.
%               Hence, sure you do not add the keyword as multiple different fields.
%               For example, plot.kws.lineWidth and plot.kws.LineWidth are the same,
%               and only one of the two will be processed.
%
%       scatter
%
%           A MATLAB struct() with the following components:
%
%               enabled
%
%                   A logical value. If `true`, the scatter() will be added to the plot.
%
%               kws
%
%                   A MATLAB struct() whose components' values are passed to 
%                   MATLAB's scatter() function. If your desired attribute is 
%                   missing from the fieldnames of scatter.kws, simply add 
%                   a new field named as the attribute and assign the desired 
%                   value to it.
%
%           Example usage:
%
%               scatter.enabled = true; % add scatter()
%
%           WARNING
%
%               Keep in mind that MATLAB keyword arguments are case-INsensitive.
%               Hence, sure you do not add the keyword as multiple different fields.
%               For example, scatter.kws.lineWidth and scatter.kws.LineWidth are the same,
%               and only one of the two will be processed.
